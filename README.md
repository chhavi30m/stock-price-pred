# stock-price-pred
With the past closing and opening prices of Tata Consultancy Services (NSE) from Yahoo Screener(csv), this model uses Linear Regression from scratch and matplotlib in order to predict closing price given the opening price. The libraries used are matplotlib (for visualization), pandas (only for importing the csv and reading it) and statistics.
The formula used to calculate the slope(m) for y=mx+b was Pearson's Correlation Coefficients.
